The accelerator backend: everything core openpilot calls, and nothing else.

A module of functions behind sunnypilot.accelerators, the only thing core
openpilot imports. Anything only a provisioning run needs lives in provision,
helpers or spec_cache.
The `jetlink` package can be absent on a device. This module stands on its
comma layer, jetlink.comma, and does not import without it;
sunnypilot.accelerators answers the negative defaults then.
